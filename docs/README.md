# Laravel Subby

**Laravel Subby** is a flexible plans and subscription management system for Laravel.
Originally forked from [rinvex/laravel-subscriptions](https://github.com/rinvex/laravel-subscriptions).

## What it does
The way this package is made, there are [plans](/models/plan-model.md) that have [features](/models/plan-feature-model.md), and then there is an entity receiving the trait of having [subscriptions](/models/plan-subscription-model.md). It can be an user, a team, whatever you want; see [Attach Subscriptions to model](/install/#attach-subscription). This entity can be subscribed to one or more plans and use its features.

## Considerations
- Payments and translations are out of scope for this package.
- You may want to extend some core models, in case you need to override the logic behind some helper methods like `renew()`, `cancel()` etc. E.g.: when cancelling a subscription you may want to also cancel the recurring payment attached.

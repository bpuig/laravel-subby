# Plan Feature Model
This model relates to which features has a Plan.

## Create plan features
Features are things that you plan allows you to do. They can be resettable or a fixed value.
```php
use Bpuig\Subby\Models\Plan;

$plan = Plan::find(1);

// Create multiple plan features at once
$plan->features()->saveMany([
    new PlanFeature(['tag' => 'social_profiles', 'name' => 'Social profiles available', 'value' => 3, 'sort_order' => 1]),
    new PlanFeature(['tag' => 'posts_per_social_profile', 'name' => 'Scheduled posts per profile', 'value' => 30, 'sort_order' => 10, 'resettable_period' => 1, 'resettable_interval' => 'month']),
    new PlanFeature(['tag' => 'analytics', 'name' => 'Analytics', 'value' => true, 'sort_order' => 15])
]);
```

## Get Plan Feature value<a name="get-feature-value"></a>

Say you want to show the value of the feature _posts_per_social_profile_ from above. You can do so in many ways:

```php
use Bpuig\Subby\Models\Plan;
use Bpuig\Subby\Models\PlanFeature;
use Bpuig\Subby\Models\PlanSubscription;

$plan = Plan::find(1);

// Use the plan instance to get feature's value
$amountOfPosts = $plan->getFeatureByTag('posts_per_social_profile')->value;

// Query the feature itself directly
$amountOfPosts = PlanFeature::where('tag', 'posts_per_social_profile')->first()->value;

// Get feature value through the subscription instance
$amountOfPosts = PlanSubscription::find(1)->getFeatureValue('posts_per_social_profile');
```

## Feature Options<a name="feature-options"></a>

Plan features are great for fine-tuning subscriptions, you can top up certain feature for X times of usage, so users may then use it only for that amount. Features also have the ability to be resettable and then it's usage could be expired too. See the following examples:

```php
use Bpuig\Subby\Models\PlanFeature;

// Find plan feature
$feature = PlanFeature::where('tag', 'posts_per_social_profile')->first();

// Get feature reset date
$feature->getResetDate(new \Carbon\Carbon());
```
